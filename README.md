# Closest-Pair-of-Point-Algorithm
this program implements the closest pair of points algorithm. Output will be the distance between the closest pair of points in every recursive call (including the overall solution). To make sure that we get the same results for every call, when there is an odd number of items, the left group (smaller x-coordinates) has one more item than the right group (larger x-coordinates). In any subproblem with three or fewer points, calculate the distances using brute-force. Runs in O(n log n) time. Input file will consist of n points, with n specified on the first line, and n additional lines containing the x- and y-coordinates, which will be real numbers (not integers).
